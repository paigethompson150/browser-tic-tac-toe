# Browser Tic Tac Toe

### Description
Here I practiced using as little global code as possible, while documenting my code and tucking them away into modules, functions, and factories. Right now the computer chooses a random position on the gameboard for its move, but I'm currently working on implementing the minimax decision rule to eventually make the computer unbeatable.

## Instrucions
- Navigate to https://paigethompson150.github.io/browser-tic-tac-toe
- Click on the screen to begin!
- Choose a position on the grid to place your move (X). Wait a second for the computer to make its move.
- Try your best to win! (It shouldn't be too hard because the computer is very dumb :))
